                The game is played on an 8x8 checkered board, with each player starting with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward, aiming to jump over and capture their opponent's pieces. If a player's piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it is crowned and gains additional abilities, making it more powerful.
